            <h2>Our Full Story: The Metawin Deception</h2>
            <p>
                After months as an affiliate, I'm blowing the whistle on Metawin Casino for fraudulent practices,
                broken VIP promises, forced fiat banking despite crypto agreements, and non-existent customer support.
                If you're an affiliate or high-roller, read my full account before doing business with them.
            </p>
            <p class="italic-text">
                People are already losing to the house edge, why being so greedy and scamming the people that makes them popular.
            </p>

            <h4>The Bait: Promises of Crypto Payouts & VIPs</h4>
            <p>
                I joined Metawin’s affiliate program late last year, negotiating directly with their representative,
                "Phil." The appeal was clear: crypto-based payouts for affiliates, a decent rev-share, and the ability
                to bring high-value VIPs from other major sites. My very first referral was a real-life friend
                (my <strong>brother-in-law</strong>) who signed up from my own house, played regularly,
                and deposited as agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the outset, there was a mandatory two-month waiting period before they paid out the $100 referral
                bonus. I waited. But after that, I checked my affiliate panel—and my referred player had disappeared
                without so much as an email or notification. With no onsite support, I spent days chasing Discord reps
                until I finally got Phil’s email.
            </p>
            <p>
                He claimed there was a "shared IP" concern (despite full explanations and proof of the player's IRL
                relationship and his home address). After weeks of going in circles, they eventually reinstated my
                player and paid me the bonus, plus a <strong>single month of rev-share (in crypto, as promised)</strong>.
                For a moment, I thought it was sorted.
            </p>

            <h4>The Switch: When the Money Got Real</h4>
            <p>
                Once my rev-share balance began to grow over the following two months, things suddenly changed:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metawin <strong>stopped all further crypto payments</strong>, demanding fiat banking info and KYC (nowhere in the original agreement).</li>
                <li>When I asked for the crypto option, I got silence or deflection.</li>
                <li>They suddenly <strong>revived the “self-referral” excuse</strong>, despite already investigating and clearing it before paying me.</li>
                <li>Support became virtually unreachable—Telegram admins and Discord reps just passed the buck.</li>
                <li>My affiliate dashboard broke, making it impossible to track earnings or referrals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The VIP Player Betrayal</h4>
            <p>
                At the same time, I’d brought in two high-roller players from Stake/Shuffle, under explicit agreements
                for their Salon Rouge VIP status:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player 1: $10,000 deposit</strong>, promised 80% loss-back in 24 hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Player 2: $10,000 deposit</strong>, $5,000 upfront bonus + Salon Rouge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Both players received VIP status, only to be <strong>downgraded days later with zero transparency</strong>,
                simply told they hadn’t “played enough” (never part of the deal, and the volume required was never disclosed).
                I now look like a scammer to my own contacts.
            </p>
